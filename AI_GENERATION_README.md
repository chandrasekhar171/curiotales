- **Primary**: Free LLM API (no authentication required)
- **Secondary**: Groq API (free tier with high performance)
- **Fallback**: Hugging Face Inference API (free tier)
- **Backup**: Curated fallback stories if APIs are unavailable

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified
- `services/storyGenerator.ts` - Main story generation service
- `services/apiConfig.ts` - API configuration and fallback setup
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Updated to use live generation
- `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` - Updated documentation

### API Configuration
The system uses multiple free APIs with automatic fallback:

1. **Hugging Face Inference API**
   - Models: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium, gpt2, distilgpt2
   - Free tier: 1000 requests/month
   - No authentication required for basic usage

2. **Alternative APIs**
   - FreeAI API
   - MLVoca API
   - Other free LLM services

### Story Generation Process
1. User selects age range and topic/category
2. System creates age-appropriate prompt
3. API call made to primary service
4. If primary fails, tries fallback APIs
5. Content cleaned and formatted
6. If all APIs fail, returns curated fallback story

## Usage

### For Users
1. **NEW**: Select either an age range OR a topic first (flexible order!)
2. Choose the remaining option (topic if you selected age, or age if you selected topic)
3. Story generates automatically when both are selected
4. Use "ðŸ¤– Generate New AI Story" to create different versions

### For Developers
```typescript
import { StoryGenerator } from '@/services/storyGenerator';

const story = await StoryGenerator.generateStory({
  topic: 'dinosaurs',
  category: 'Science',
  ageRange: '5-7 years'
});
```
