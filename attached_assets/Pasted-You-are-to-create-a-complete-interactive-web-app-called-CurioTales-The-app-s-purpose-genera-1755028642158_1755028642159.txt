## FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR
When the user provides a topic (either via search or tag click):
- The app requests from the AI agent 5–8 engaging, unusual, and *share-worthy* facts or micro-stories.
- These must be factual, intriguing, and worded in a friendly, clear tone.
- Avoid generic, obvious facts. Prioritize surprising or little-known details.
- Keep each entry to a max of ~70 words.
- If a fact could be made visually engaging, suggest a small, fitting icon or illustration idea in metadata.
